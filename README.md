## Attachment Style Test

deployed at: https://attachmentstyletest.org

This app is inspired by a book on adult attachment styles I read last summer.
I disliked all of the quizes I could find on the internet both content and implementation
wise. So I decided to code my own.

Distinguishing features:
- a pdf with all the questions and answers is generated at the end ready for download
- extra quiz to asses other people with more behavior-based questions
- dashboard representing the global results based on a few demographic features

Above all, however, this is just a coding exercise for myself. I wanted to see if one
could use Dash Plotly to build a full-fledged interactive website without any html
or javascript. It is by no means the right tool for the job, but it is fun to see 
what it is, in principle, capable of.
