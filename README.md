## Attachment Style Test

deployed at: https://attachmentstyletest.org

This app is inspired by a book on adult attachment styles I read last summer.
I disliked all of the quizes I could find on the internet both content and implementation
wise. So I decided to code my own.

Distinguishing features:
- user can download the pdf with all the questions and answers
- extra quiz to asses other people with more behavior-based questions
- dashboard representing the global results based on a few demographic features

Above all, however, this is just a coding exercise for myself. I wanted to see if one
could use Dash Plotly to build a full fledged interactive website. It is by no means 
the right tool for the job, but it is fun to see what it is, in principle, capable of.

ToDos:
- tests for correctness!
- send to the adlershof chat for feedback

- basic code cleanup, comments
- look into possible refactoring (answers as object instead of dict) and optimizations
- contact plotly guy
- contact the authors

- translate to German and Russian

- clean up dependencies  
- document features
- document what I learned
