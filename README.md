## Website in pure Python!

Interactive attachment style quiz with a global insights dashboard and downloadable PDF reports.

Current deployment at: https://attachment-style.fly.dev/

Distinguishing features:
- a pdf with all the questions and answers is generated at the end ready for download
- extra quiz to assess other people with more behavior-based questions
- dashboard representing the global results based on a few demographic features

I wanted to see if one
could use Dash Plotly to build a full-fledged interactive website without any html
or javascript.
