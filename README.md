## Website in pure Python!

Current deployment (in active development) at: https://attachment-style.fly.dev/

This app is inspired by a book on adult attachment styles I read last summer.
I disliked all of the quizes I could find on the internet both content and implementation
wise. So I decided to code my own.

Distinguishing features:
- a pdf with all the questions and answers is generated at the end ready for download
- extra quiz to asses other people with more behavior-based questions
- dashboard representing the global results based on a few demographic features

Above all, however, this is just a coding exercise for myself. I wanted to see if one
could use Dash Plotly to build a full-fledged interactive website without any html
or javascript.
