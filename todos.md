- [x] test backend for ecr-r (simple click through)
- [x] calculate secure score from ecr-r scores for the dashboard graphs
- [x] let the database (backend) do the heavy lifting instead of the dashboard!
- [x] adjust assess others to 1-7 scale
- [x] generate test data for ecr-r

# backend

- [x] clear the store components when switching to a different page!
- [x] provide total number of scores with and without test
- [x] separate updating data from the db and filtering (include/exclude test, you/others)
      (then don't even need extra chaching)
