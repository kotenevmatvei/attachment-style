I find it easy to be affectionate with my partner
I feel comfortable depending on romantic partners
I am generally satisfied with my romantic relationships
I don't feel the need to act out much in my romantic relationships
I habe little difficulty expressing my needs and wants to my partner
I believe most people are essentially honest and dependable
I'm comfortable sharing my personal thoughts and feelings with my partner
An argument with my partner doesn't usually cause me to question out entire relationship
Sometimes people see me as boring because I create little drama in relationships
When I disagree with someone, I feel comfortable expressing my opinions
If I notice that someone I'm interested in is checking out other pople, I don't let it faze me. I might feel a pang of jealousy, but it's fleeting
If someone I've been dating begins to act cold and distant, I may wonder what's happened, but I'll know it's probably not about me
If someone I've been dating for several months tells me s/he wants to stop seeing me, I'd feel hurt at first, but I'd get over it
I won't have much of a problem staying in touch with my ex (strictly platonic) - after all, we have a lot in common
