    Anxious: You love to be very close to your romantic partners and have the capacity

    close as you would like him/her to be. Relationships tend to consume a large part of 
    your emotional energy. You tend to be very sensitive to small fluctuations in your 
    partner’s moods and actions, and although your senses are often accurate, you take 
    your partner’s behaviors too personally. You experience a lot of negative emotions 
    within the relationship and get easily upset. As a result, you tend to act out and 
    say things you later regret. If the other person provides a lot of security and 
    reassurance, however, you are able to shed much of your preoccupation and feel 
    contented.

    over relationship matters. You effectively communicate your needs and feelings 
    to your partner and are strong at reading your partner’s emotional cues and

    time  worrying about your romantic relationships or about being rejected. You 
    tend not to open up to your partners and they often complain that you are
