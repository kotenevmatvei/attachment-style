* Seems distant and aloof yet vulnerable at the same time (which you find irresistible).
* Sometimes calls a lot nd other times not at all.
* Says something intimate like "When we move in together..."; but later acts as though you don't have a future as couple
*Values his/her independence greatly* - looks down on dependency and "neediness."
* "I need a lot of space."
* "My work takes up so much of my time there's no room for anyone serious in my life right now."
* "I could never be with someone who isn't completely self-sufficient."
