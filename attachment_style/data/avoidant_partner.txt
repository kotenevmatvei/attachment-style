*Sends mixed signals.*\n* Seems distant and aloof yet vulnerable at the same time (which you find irresistible).\n* Sometimes calls a lot nd other times not at all.\n* Says something intimate like "When we move in together..."; but later acts as though you don't have a future as couple
*Values his/her independence greatly* - looks down on dependency and "neediness."\n* "I need a lot of space."\n* "My work takes up so much of my time there's no room for anyone serious in my life right now."\n* "I could never be with someone who isn't completely self-sufficient."
