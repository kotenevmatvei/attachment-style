I find that I bounce back quickly after a breakup. It's weird how I can just put someone out of my mind
I find it difficult to emotionally support my partner when s/he is feeling down
My independence is more important to me than my relationships
I prefer not to share my innermost feelings with my partner
I find it difficult to depend on romantic partners
I sometimes feel angry or annoyed with my partner without knowing why
I prefer casual sex with uncommitted partners to intimate sex with one person
It makes me nervous when my partner gets too close
My partners often want me to be more intimate that I feel comfortable being
I miss my partner when we're apart, but then when we're together I feel the need to escape
I hate feeling that other people depend on me
If I notice that someone I'm interested in is checking out other people, I feel relieved - it means s/he's not looking to make things exclusive
If someone I've been dating begins to act cold and distant; I'll probably be indifferent, I might even be relieved
Sometimes when I get what I want in a relationship, I'm not sure what I want anymore
