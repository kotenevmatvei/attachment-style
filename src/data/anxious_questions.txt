I often worry that my partner will stop loving me
I fear that once someone gets to know the real me, s/he won't like who I am
When I'm not involved in a relationship, I feel somewhat anxious and incomplete
When my partner is away, I'm afraid that s/he might become interested in someone else
When I show my partner how I feel, I'm afraid s/he will not feel the same about me
I think obout my relationships a lot
I tend to get very quickly attached to a romantic partner
I am very sensitive to my partner's moods
I worry that if my partner leaves me I might never find someone else
During a conflict, I tend to impulsively do or say things I later regret, rather than be able to reason about things
I worry that I'm not attractive enough
If I notice that someone I'm interested in is checking out other people, it makes me feel depressed
If someone I've been dating begins to act cold and distant, I'll worry that I've done something wrong
If my partner was to break up with me, I'd try my best to show her/him what s/he is missing (a little jealousy can't hurt)
